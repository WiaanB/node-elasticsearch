# Express + ElasticSearch

This is was an app I built in preparation for joining the development team fulltime at Sintrex. I have never used the ElasticSearch stack before, so I ran a node on Docker, which I then connected to via my Express app. I simply tested CRUD functionalities via Postman and troubleshooting.
